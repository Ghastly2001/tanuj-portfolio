              I&apos;m Tanuj Pandey, a designer working across Fashion and UX. I
              enjoy learning through doing and being part of work that pushes me
              to think differently and grow with every step.

              Design, for me, is about solving real problems and creating
              experiences that are clear, useful, and honest â€” whether it&apos;s
              a garment or a digital product. I care about how things look,
              feel, and function, and I pay close attention to the small details
              that bring it all together.

              I like working in fast-paced environments where I can stay
              curious, take initiative, and keep learning along the way.
